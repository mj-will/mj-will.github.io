## Introduction

Plotting in Python is often as easy as importing `matplotlib.pyplot` and calling functions such as `figure` and `plot`. But sometimes I've wanted to go a step further and make a slightly more complex figure or customise some of defaults and whilst I think matplotlib's documentation is generally pretty good, I've often found myself digging through posts on StackOverflow to find a single line that fixes all the problems I've been having. With this in mind, I'm going to use this site as a place to keep code snippets and and scripts that I've found useful in the hope it will also benefit others.

A quick disclamer, I'm a physicist by training so the code I include may a times not be optimal but rather just enough to get the job done. If you feel you can improve upon what I've included by all means feel free to submit changes to the git repo that hosts this site.

## Python and Packages

I'll be using Python 3 in all of the examples and will be focusing on using `matplotlib` with some examples using `seaborn` and `corner`. Whenever I'm using these packages my first port of call is always the documentation, so I highly recommend having a look at their documentation if you're not familiar with them.

## Be Prepared

This is project is very much in it's infancy and needs a lot of work so be prepared typos, bugs dead links and a plethora of other quirky things!
