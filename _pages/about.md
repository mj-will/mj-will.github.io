Hi, I'm Michael, a Research Fellow at the Institute of Cosmology & Gravitation at the University of Portsmouth.
My main research interest is the intersection between gravitational-wave astrophysics, machine learning and Bayesian statistics.
I'm also a member of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, where I hold the role of Parameter Estimation co-chair, and I recently
joined the LISA Consortium.

I first got involved in gravitational-wave research as an undergraduate intern working with
Chris Messenger in the [Institute for Gravitational Research][igr] at the University of Glasgow.
The projected involved training a convolutional neural network to detect gravitational-wave
signals from binary black hole mergers.

I then did my PhD with John Veitch and Chris Messenger at the [Institute for Gravitational research][igr]
and focused on developing techniques to accelerate Bayesian inference algorithms for
characterizing gravitational-wave signals.
