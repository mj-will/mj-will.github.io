<p>Gravitational physics and astronomy have developed rapidly over the last decade, driven by new observations and theoretical breakthroughs. As new as the science and technology of this field are, its greatest asset may be the body of early-career researchers actively engaged in driving it forward. With the aim of bringing together this community of enthusiastic scientists from a broad array of disciplines, the organisers of the GR-Amaldi meeting joined with the Gravitational-Wave Early Career Scientists organisation to create a three-day event: the Early Career Workshop. The Workshop aimed to provide a broad overview of the field's diverse scientific possibilities and introduce key theoretical foundations underpinning its science. To complement developing technical skills, the Workshop also sought to provide participants with transferable skills to aid them in their future careers. The Workshop emphasized networking and community building, offering participants opportunities to engage with peers and mentors. It encouraged interdisciplinary exchanges and cross-institutional collaboration, fostering connections across different research efforts. Collectively, these initiatives aimed to equip participants with a comprehensive understanding of the field's research and to build a more cohesive, collaborative community of early-career researchers. We summarise key points and conclusion from the carious activities carried out as part of the Workshop.</p>
