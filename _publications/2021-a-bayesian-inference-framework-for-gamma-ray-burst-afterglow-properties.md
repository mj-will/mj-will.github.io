<p>In the field of multi-messenger astronomy, Bayesian inference is commonly adopted to compare the compatibility of models given the observed data. However, to describe a physical system like neutron star mergers and their associated gamma-ray burst (GRB) events, usually more than ten physical parameters are incorporated in the model. With such a complex model, likelihood evaluation for each Monte Carlo sampling point becomes a massive task and requires a significant amount of computational power. In this work, we perform quick parameter estimation on simulated GRB X-ray light curves using an interpolated physical GRB model. This is achieved by generating a grid of GRB afterglow light curves across the parameter space and replacing the likelihood with a simple interpolation function in the high-dimensional grid that stores all light curves. This framework, compared to the original method, leads to a <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>&#x0007E;</mi></mrow></math>90<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>&#x000D7;</mi></mrow></math> speedup per likelihood estimation. It will allow us to explore different jet models and enable fast model comparison in the future.</p>
